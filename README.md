## Overview
The purpose of the analysis is to design a web page that provides data about UFO sightings. The data used in the page was supplied as a data.js file with 111 different instances of UFO sightings. Each instance provides the date, city, state, country, shape, duration, and comments specific to the sighting. On the web page the data is set up in a table, and the following five filters are available to the user to allow for drilling into the information.
- Date
- City
- State
- Country
- Shape    

## Results
The filters allow the user to chose any or all of the filters to find specific data. For example, in the following image below all 5 filters are used to filter the table to just two  rows:

## Summary
The website is functional, the filters do what they should, and provides all the data that has been supplied. Some issues with the site are:
- It still seems pretty plain
- The data on the sight is limited to only the initial information that has been provided

    
A few recommendations I would make are:
- Where possible add links in the table that allow viewers to see the images of the UFO sighting being described
- More color could be added to make the sight more appealing.
